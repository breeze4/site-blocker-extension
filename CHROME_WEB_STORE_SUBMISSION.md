üõ°Ô∏è PERMISSIONS EXPLAINED

This extension requires broad permissions (<all_urls>) because:
‚Ä¢ Users can block any website - we can't predict which domains
‚Ä¢ Content scripts display blocking messages on any site when time expires
‚Ä¢ Tab redirection is needed to enforce time limits
‚Ä¢ All permissions are used solely for core site blocking functionality

Your privacy is protected - we never read page content or collect personal data.

    <h1>Privacy Policy for Site Timer Blocker</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: [Current Date]</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Site Timer Blocker is designed with privacy as a core principle. This extension operates entirely within your browser and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We collect NO personal data.</strong> The extension does not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track your browsing history</li>
        <li>Read page content from websites you visit</li>
        <li>Collect personal information</li>
        <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>Transmit data to external servers</li>
        <li>Share data with third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The extension stores the following data locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Domain Timer Settings:</strong> Website domains you choose to track and their time limits</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Time spent on tracked domains (stored as daily totals)</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your chosen settings like reset intervals</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data remains on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Usage</h2>
    <p>The extension requires broad permissions (&lt;all_urls&gt;) for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Save your settings and usage data locally</li>
        <li><strong>Active Tab:</strong> Monitor which sites you're visiting to start timers</li>
        <li><strong>Tabs:</strong> Redirect you when time limits are reached</li>
        <li><strong>All URLs:</strong> Enable blocking on any website you choose to track</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for site blocking functionality, not data collection.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally in your browser:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data is protected by Chrome's security model</li>
        <li>No data transmission means no interception risk</li>
        <li>You can delete all data by removing the extension</li>
        <li>Data does not sync across devices unless you enable Chrome sync</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Site Timer Blocker does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This extension does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted here and in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about this privacy policy can be submitted through the Chrome Web Store support tab for Site Timer Blocker.</p>

## ‚öñÔ∏è Permissions Justification

**Copy this for the "Permissions" section:**

```
REQUIRED PERMISSIONS EXPLANATION:

Storage: Saves your site timer settings and usage analytics locally in your browser. No data is transmitted externally.

Active Tab: Monitors which website you're currently visiting to start and stop timers appropriately. Only domain names are accessed, not page content.

Tabs: Enables redirecting you away from sites when time limits are reached - the core blocking functionality.

Host Permissions (<all_urls>): Required because users can add ANY website to their timer list. We cannot predict which domains users want to block, so broad permissions are necessary for:
- Injecting content scripts to display blocking messages
- Redirecting tabs when time expires  
- Monitoring any domain for timer enforcement

PRIVACY COMMITMENT: Despite broad permissions, this extension NEVER reads page content, collects personal data, or transmits information to external servers. All functionality is local-only for site blocking purposes.
```
