# Site Blocker extension

When you want very limited access to sites, just enough to view random links you come across, but no so much you can waste a lot of time.

## Features:
* Can add/remove domains and associated timers
* Shows a block page when a domain has run out of time
* Stops the timer when you navigate from a page
* Starts the timer when you navigate to a domain
* When the time expires and you're on the page, so far nothing happens; if you navigate within that domain, it will send you to a blank page
* Timers reset after an interval has passed, configurable
* TODO: support subdomains automatically
