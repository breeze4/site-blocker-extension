# Chrome Extension Release Checklist

### ‚úÖ Manifest V3 & Core Setup

- [x] **`manifest.json` is V3 Compliant**: Ensure your manifest file is using `"manifest_version": 3`. Manifest V2 extensions are no longer accepted.
- [x] **Required Fields**: Your `manifest.json` must include `manifest_version`, `name`, and `version`. The name should be short and clear (max 45 characters).
- [ ] **Permissions**: Request only the permissions your extension absolutely needs. Use `activeTab` instead of broad host permissions (e.g., `<all_urls>`) whenever possible. Clearly explain why you need each permission in your store listing.
- [x] **Service Worker**: Replace background scripts with a service worker (`"background": { "service_worker": "..." }`). Ensure your logic is event-based and doesn't rely on a persistent state.
- [ ] **Content Scripts**: Define `matches` precisely to inject scripts only on necessary pages. Use `"run_at": "document_idle"` unless you need scripts to run earlier.
- [ ] **Icons**: Provide icons in all required sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels. The 128px icon is used for the Chrome Web Store listing.

### üíª Code Quality & Performance

- [ ] **Code Minification**: Minify your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files to reduce the extension's size and improve load times.
- [x] **Asynchronous Code**: Use asynchronous methods (`async`/`await` or Promises) for all Chrome API calls that support it (e.g., `chrome.storage.local.get`).
- [x] **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, especially for API calls and user interactions. Use `try...catch` blocks and check `chrome.runtime.lastError`.
- [x] **Clean Code**: Remove all development code, such as `console.log()` statements, commented-out code blocks, and unused files or libraries.
- [x] **Efficient Storage**: Use `chrome.storage.local` for user data and settings. Avoid using `localStorage` as it's synchronous and can slow down your extension. For configuration data that syncs across devices, use `chrome.storage.sync`.

### üõ°Ô∏è Security

- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define a strict `content_security_policy` in your `manifest.json`. Avoid using `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`. Load all scripts and resources locally from within the extension package.
- [x] **No `eval()`**: Do not use `eval()`, `new Function()`, or `setTimeout()` with a string argument. These can create vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Sanitize Inputs**: Sanitize all user input and data fetched from external sources to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Use libraries like DOMPurify if you need to render external HTML.
- [x] **External Requests**: If fetching from an external server, ensure the server uses HTTPS. Explicitly list the domains in the `host_permissions` field in your manifest.

### ‚ú® User Interface & Experience

- [x] **Intuitive UI**: Ensure the popup UI (if any) is simple, clean, and easy to understand.
- [ ] **Onboarding**: Provide a simple onboarding experience for first-time users. This can be a welcome page (using `chrome.runtime.onInstalled`) or a brief tutorial.
- [x] **Options Page**: If your extension is configurable, create a user-friendly options page.
- [ ] **Dark Mode Support**: Add CSS rules to support both light and dark modes using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y)**: Use proper semantic HTML, add ARIA attributes where necessary, and ensure your extension is navigable using only a keyboard.

### üöÄ Chrome Web Store Listing & Pre-Launch

- [ ] **Create Developer Account**: Register for a Chrome Web Store developer account. There is a one-time $5 registration fee.
- [ ] **Compelling Store Listing**:
    - [ ] **Extension Name**: Finalize a unique and descriptive name.
    - [ ] **Detailed Description**: Clearly explain what your extension does, its main features, and why users should install it.
    - [ ] **Promotional Images**: Create high-quality screenshots (1280x800 or 640x400 pixels) and a promotional tile (440x280 pixels). An optional YouTube video can be very effective.
    - [ ] **Privacy Policy**: If you handle any user data, you **must** provide a link to a clear and accessible privacy policy.
- [ ] **Final Packaging**: Create a `.zip` file of your extension's directory. Make sure to exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, and any other development-related files.
- [ ] **Testing**:
    - [ ] **Cross-Browser (if applicable)**: Test on Chrome-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and Opera.
    - [ ] **Manual Testing**: Thoroughly test all features, user flows, and edge cases.
    - [ ] **Beta Testers**: Upload the extension as "Unlisted" or "Private" and share the link with a small group of beta testers for feedback.

### üéâ Submission & Post-Launch

- [ ] **Submit for Review**: Upload your `.zip` file to the developer dashboard, fill out all required fields (including permission justifications), and submit for review.
- [ ] **Monitor Review Status**: The review process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. Be prepared to answer questions or make changes if requested by the review team.
- [ ] **Engage with Users**: After launch, monitor user feedback from the "Support" tab in the Chrome Web Store. Respond to reviews and bug reports promptly.
- [ ] **Analytics**: Consider adding a lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics 4) to understand user behavior and guide future updates. You must disclose this in your privacy policy.
